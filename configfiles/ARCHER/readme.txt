
If your router does not want to accept the ROOter firmware then follow
these steps.

1. Flash with DD-WRT 3rd party software. It's a specific beta version, 
made to get around this US version issue:

Archer-C7-factory-to-ddwrt-US.bin

2. Flash again with a unique revert firmware made to take back to TP-Link factory from DD-WRT. 
In this case, it goes back to FW version 3.13.34 Build 131217 Rel 60903n :

ArcherC7v2_en_3_14_3.bin

3. NOW, the Archer is able to flash to ROOter using the factory firmware.

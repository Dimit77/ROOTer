If your router using factory firmware will not accept the ROOter image then
you have a choice of two methods to make it work.

To use Method 1 go to the 'method1' folder and follow the insructions
in the readme.txt file. This will flash your router to a special factory firmware
that allows ROOter to be installed.

To use Method 2 go to the 'method2' folder and select the firmware that matches your region, 
either US or Europe. These are the same image as the ROOter firmware but set up for a specific
region. If this does not work you will have to use Method 1.
